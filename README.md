# python_projects
This is my python learning journey where I sharpen my coding skill with different projects. 

I've been an inspiring Pythonista for a while now and it's the year 2025, one of my new-year resolutions is to take learning how to code more seriously. And this repository shall be the main witness and judge of my commitment:)

The list of projects is as follows:
  1. A flashcards generator that help users revise either English to Czech or Czech to English vocabularies - I actually use this daily (data is from a Google Sheet workbook)
  2. A quiz game that questions your knowledge of the capitals of the world (data is pulled from an open API URL)
  3. My own version of a hangman game - an animals' version (data is collected through web scraping using BeautifulSoup)
  4. A current weather reporter (data is from OpenWeather using API keys)
