# python_projects
This is my python learning journey where I sharpen my coding skill with different projects. 

I've been an inspiring Pythonista for a while now and it's the year 2025, one of my new-year resolutions is to take learning how to code more seriously. And this repository shall be the main witness and judge of my commitment.

I'm determined to finish one project per week, starting with beginner-friendly tasks and working my way up.

The list of projects is as follows:
  - Week 1: I created a flashcard generator that I've actually been using daily. It helps me refresh my memory of the Czech vocabularies.
  - Week 2: I created a quiz game that questions your knowledge of the capitals of the world.
